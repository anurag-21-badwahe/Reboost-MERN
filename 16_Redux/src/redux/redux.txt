1) Store - Is  holds all the data your application uses.

2)Reducer - is manipulates that data when it recieves an action.

3)Action -> What you wanna do, eg: event click

4)Dispatch -> Way how we execute the action. eg: Dispatch the action to the reducer.
 Then reducer will check what to do and the store gets updated.
