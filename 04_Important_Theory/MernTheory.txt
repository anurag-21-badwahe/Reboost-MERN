Q2)What are dependencies and devDependencies in package.json?

Dependencies are packages required for the application to run, while devDependencies are packages 
required for development and testing purposes only.

Q3)Can you have multiple package.json files in a single project?

No, typically a Node.js project has only one package.json file located at the root directory of 
the project.

Q4)What is the significance of the main field in package.json?

The main field specifies the entry point of the module. When someone imports your
module, Node.js will look for the file specified in the main field.

Q5) Version in package.json
"version": "^1.0.0": This means any version from 1.0.0 up to, but not including, 2.0.0.
"version": "~1.0.0": This means any version from 1.0.0 up to, but not including, 1.1.0.

Q6) require vs imports
"require" in Node.js can be synchronous or asynchronous depending on the module being loaded.
"import" in JavaScript is always asynchronous, making it more suitable for modern asynchronous programming patterns.
